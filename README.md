### Hi there, I'm Anna Fonte 



:woman_technologist: &nbsp;  Iâ€™m currently diving deep into **Data Analytics** and **Data Engineering** with **Python**.


:file_folder: &nbsp; In this profile you will find my **main projects**:
* [Spotify Song Recommender](https://github.com/annafonte/spotify-song-recommender): my first end-to-end project, using Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Spotify API. Clustering songs based on its audio features. 
* [Data Revolution for a Sustainable World](https://github.com/annafonte/forecasting-sdgs): forecasting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, using FBProphet library. 
* [Extracting emotion through Machine Learning](https://github.com/annafonte/nlp-tripadvisor): performing sentiment analysis of a tourist attraction, and finding correlation between the human and machine sentiment.
* And some more are on its way... 

:inbox_tray: &nbsp; If you have any suggestion, you can reach me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annafonte/) profile.
